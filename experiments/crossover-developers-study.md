# Developers Experimentation

> Crossover study, a variant of within-subject design inwhich all participants are exposed sequentially to all variances of the task

## Objectives

* Compare the effort required, with and without the approach, to develop and maintain a frontend that uses an evolving API -> Unit? Time?
* Obtain an evaluation of the effort felt by the developer -> scale from 1 to 8?
* Would the developers consider using it on a new project? Why?
* Would the developers consider implementing it on an existing project? Why?
* Identify what are the biggest barriers to developers adopting the approach
* Strengths and interests of the approach? (as seen by the developers)

## Protocol

Duration: 4 hours
Minimum Developers Required: 18

### Organization and groups

* The developers are split into groups of at least 2 where each developer works individually
* Each developer have to implement the same frontend application with the traditional approach and with the evolvable-by-design approach. Within a group, half of the developers start with the traditional approach and the other half with the evolvable-by-design approach. The developer is assigned 2 hours for each approach.
* The frontend application to build consumes an evolving API. Each group is given the same API that has five versions: an initial one and four others introducing four types of REST API evolution. The developer will then have to implement a working version of the frontend for each version of the API, with the two aforementioned approaches.
* Each group will have to handle at least one evolution that is common with another group.
* The end goal is to test all types of evolutions.
