Hi,

You are receiving this mail because you showed some interest in participating in a study on REST API co-evolution.

To give some context, Antoine Cheron, a former doctorate in the DiverSE Team in the INRIA laboratory working on REST APIs, created an approach called Evolvable-By-Design. This approach has the purpose of making it easier to update front-end code, in the case of an evolution in the backend used by your client.
In order to validate the usability of the approach and evaluate the benefits of it in the real world, we devised an experiment based on his approach. 

This experiment starts with an easy tutorial on how to use the Evolvable-By-Design approach. Then the "real" experiment starts, in which you are tasked to try to implement parts of a font-end client, and then update it according to evolutions in the backend that the client uses.

You will be using a React library called Pivo, that implements the Evolvable-By-Design approach. But you don't need to be an expert in React to do the experiment, as far as you have prior knowledge in Web Technologies.

In order to get started, you only have to carefully follow the instructions given to you in the README in this repository https://github.com/CharlyReux/evolvable-by-design-research/tree/master/experiments/crossover-developers-study.

Thanks again for participating.
