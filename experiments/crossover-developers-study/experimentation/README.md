# Pivo Crossover Developer Study

## Introduction

Hi and thank you very much for participating in this study.

Today, you will implement a frontend application in React that let the user manage a todo list. This application will connect to a REST API in order to interact with the data. Then, the REST API will evolve and you will have to update the frontend application in order to keep the application working.

You will implement this application twice, using two different methods to connect with the REST API. On the one hand, you will use a traditional approach, the industry standard, where you use an HTTP client to build correct REST API calls and manage the response. On the other hand you will use Pivo, a library that replaces the HTTP client. It offers a JavaScript API that you use to describe what to do on the REST API and what data to obtain. Then, Pivo fetches the API documentation and creates the interaction with the REST API for you. The goal of this library is to manage the evolution of the REST API for you at run-time so that you don't have to update the frontend code when the REST API evolve.

You are given two hours to implement each version of the frontend application and to update it to four evolutions of the REST API. Hence, our goal with this study is to obtain your feedbacks about the new method proposed by Pivo to design frontend applications.

## Pre-experiment Questionnaire

Before you start coding, could you please fill-in the following form: LINK HERE.

## Experiment Statement

Each one of the participants has been assign a group. Within a group, half of the participants will start with the implementation with the traditional method and the other one with Pivo. In addition, each group will have to update the frontend to different evolutions than other groups. So, we need you to make sure that you follow the right statement.
