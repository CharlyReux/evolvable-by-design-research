# Research

This repository centralises all the research related to the evolvable-by-design topic we started.

At the moment, it contains:

* [The original paper introducing the approach](./papers/Evolvable-by-design%20clients%20of%20REST%20APIs%20-%20automated%20run-time%20evolution%20with%20no%20code%20change.pdf)
* [The server of the experiment validating the feasibility of the approach](https://github.com/evolvable-by-design/evaluation-server)
* [The clients (traditional and evolvable-by-design) of the experiment validating the feasibility of the approach](https://github.com/evolvable-by-design/evaluation-client)
* [The specification of the API used for this evaluation](https://github.com/evolvable-by-design/api-evolutions)
* [The outline of a crossover developer study](/experiments/crossover-developers-study/) that compares the effort required to implement the same frontend evolving to API evolutions with both the traditional and evolvable-by-design approach.
