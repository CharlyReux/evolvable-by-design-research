# Research

This repository centralises **all the research related to the evolvable-by-design topic** we started.

At the moment, it contains:

* [The details of the case-study evaluation](/experiments/evaluation-case-study/)
* [The details of the evaluation on five use-cases](/experiments/evaluation-on-use-cases/)
* [The outline of a crossover developer study that we would like to run](/experiments/crossover-developers-study/) that compares the effort required to implement the same frontend evolving to API evolutions with both the traditional and evolvable-by-design approach.

To be added:

* Paper introducing the approach (after its submission)
